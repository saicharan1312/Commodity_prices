# Intelligent Agent for Predicting Commodity Price Changes

## Overview
This project presents an intelligent agent designed to predict changes in the prices of various commodities, including crude oil, natural gas, and gold. The agent utilizes historical price data and machine learning algorithms, including Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression, to make accurate predictions.

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms and forecasting models are employed in this project:
- **Facebook Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook for time series data forecasting. It is capable of capturing trends, seasonality, and holiday effects.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A widely used time series forecasting method that models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the observations and residual errors at prior time steps.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification and regression tasks.
- **Linear Regression**: Employed to model the relationship between independent variables and commodity prices.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Utilized for its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and capture complex patterns in the data.
